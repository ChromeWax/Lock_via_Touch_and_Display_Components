# Lock via Touch, Display, and 1 Wire components
The main goal of this project was to learn how to use embedded C to
interact with various components. This project was about tapping the
touch sensor the correct number of times per 5 second countdown. If
the touch sensor was pressed the correct number of times, the
display would turn green else red. I used a raspberry pi, a 1-wire
device to store the combination of correct presses, a display to
show countdown and final result, and a touch sensor for inputting
combination.

To run this would require plan9 running on the pi.
